## 📖 About Us
Our mission is to educate Canadians on Bitcoin. We are small but growing, and our vision is to bring Bitcoin education to as many Canadians as possible. We are Bitcoin only, and we are here for the freedom!

## 👥 Our Team
Currently, our team is small—a cozy group of four educators: Jaime, Leander, Dale, and Tylor. We are based in Regina, Saskatchewan, and we are expanding and growing our educators' team from coast-to-coast-to-coast across the Great White North. We are growing daily with inquiries from educators from Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal, and we are excited to onboard new educators and students to Bitcoin, the most revolutionary invention of our time.
